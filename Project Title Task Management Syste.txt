Project Title: Task Management System

Problem Formulation:

Keywords: Task Management, Productivity, Scheduling, User Interface, Deadline Tracking
Objectives/Aim: The objective of this project is to design a simple task management system that allows users to create, prioritize, and track tasks. It aims to improve personal productivity and organization by providing an intuitive interface and reminders for deadlines.

Description : This project involves creating a Task Management System where users can add tasks, assign deadlines, set priorities, and mark tasks as completed. The system will notify users of upcoming deadlines and allow them to sort tasks by priority or due date. The application will have a simple, user-friendly interface to help users efficiently manage their work, improve time management, and reduce task-related stress.





## Technical Details

### Methodology/Approach of Development

The development of the Task Management System will follow an **Agile** methodology, enabling iterative development with continuous feedback and improvement. This approach ensures that the application is aligned with user requirements and expectations throughout the development lifecycle.

#### Key Steps in the Approach:
1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - Conduct interviews and surveys to identify the key features and requirements for the task management system.
   - Define the user personas to understand different user needs (e.g., students, professionals, etc.).
   
2. **Design Phase**:
   - Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface (UI) to ensure the system is intuitive and easy to navigate.
   - Design the database schema for storing tasks, deadlines, and user data.

3. **Development Phase**:
   - Implement core features such as task creation, task prioritization, deadline tracking, and notifications.
   - Develop the backend for task management and a secure login system for user data.

4. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the system works as expected.
   - Conduct performance testing to ensure the system can handle multiple users and tasks efficiently.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the system on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for accessibility and scalability.
   - Provide installation packages or web-based access for users.

6. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update the application based on user feedback and address any bugs or performance issues.
   - Implement new features as required by users.

### Tools/Languages to be Used

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
   - **CSS**: For styling the user interface, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly.
   - **JavaScript**: For interactive elements, such as task management functionalities (e.g., adding, deleting, and updating tasks).
   - **React.js** (or **Vue.js**): To build a dynamic and responsive front-end with component-based architecture, improving maintainability.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building the server-side logic and handling API requests.
   - **Express.js**: A lightweight framework for creating RESTful APIs to handle user interactions like task creation, updates, and deletions.
   - **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For handling user authentication and authorization securely.
   
3. **Database**:
   - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store user tasks, deadlines, priorities, and completion statuses. It allows for flexibility in schema and scalability.
   - **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, to structure and query data more easily.

4. **Notifications**:
   - **NodeMailer**: For sending email notifications to users about upcoming deadlines or reminders.
   - **Push Notifications**: Using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for mobile app notifications (if applicable).

5. **Version Control**:
   - **Git**: For version control, ensuring the project codebase is well-managed.
   - **GitHub**: For hosting the repository and facilitating collaboration among team members.

6. **Deployment**:
   - **Heroku / AWS**: For cloud-based deployment, making the system accessible anywhere with an internet connection.
   - **Docker**: For containerization of the application to ensure consistent and easy deployment across various environments.

7. **Testing**:
   - **Jest**: For unit and integration testing to ensure that the system behaves as expected.
   - **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing of the UI, ensuring that users can perform tasks such as creating, editing, and deleting tasks without issues.

8. **Project Management and Documentation**:
   - **Jira**: For agile project management and tracking development progress through sprints.
   - **Confluence**: For maintaining project documentation, including requirements, design decisions, and testing reports.

This combination of tools and languages will allow for the development of a feature-rich, efficient, and scalable Task Management System.




I currently don't have the ability to generate flowchart diagrams directly. However, I can describe the flowchart for the Task Management System in detail, which you can use to create the diagram using a flowchart tool like Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio, or even online tools like draw.io.

### Detailed Flowchart Description

#### **Start**:
- Begin the process of using the Task Management System.

#### **User Login/Signup**:
1. **Login Screen**:
   - The user provides login credentials (email, password).
   - **Decision**: Is the login successful?
     - Yes: Proceed to the Dashboard.
     - No: Display error message and prompt for re-entry.

2. **Signup Option**:
   - If the user is new, they can sign up by providing an email, password, and other necessary details.
   - Once signed up, proceed to the login screen.

#### **Dashboard (Main Screen)**:
3. **Display Task List**:
   - Show a list of tasks, prioritized and sorted by deadlines or user-defined categories.

4. **Options**:
   - Add New Task
   - Sort Tasks (by priority, deadline, etc.)
   - View Task Details
   - Logout

#### **Add New Task**:
5. **Task Details Form**:
   - The user enters the task name, description, priority, and deadline.
   - **Decision**: Is the task data valid?
     - Yes: Save the task in the database and show the updated task list.
     - No: Show an error message and prompt the user to correct the details.

#### **Edit or View Task**:
6. **View Task Details**:
   - Clicking on a task shows details (name, description, priority, and deadline).
   
7. **Edit Task**:
   - Option to modify any task field (e.g., change priority, deadline, or description).
   - Save changes to the database.

#### **Delete Task**:
8. **Delete Option**:
   - If the user decides to delete a task, a confirmation prompt appears.
   - **Decision**: Is the user sure they want to delete?
     - Yes: Remove the task from the system and refresh the task list.
     - No: Go back to the task view.

#### **Task Completion**:
9. **Mark Task as Completed**:
   - The user can mark a task as completed from the task list or task details page.
   - Update task status to "completed" in the database.

#### **Notifications**:
10. **Deadline Reminder**:
    - The system checks upcoming deadlines at regular intervals.
    - **Decision**: Is there a task approaching its deadline?

### Flowchart Creation

You can use the following symbols for creating the flowchart:
- **Oval**: Start/End points.
- **Rectangle**: Processes or actions (e.g., user login, task addition).
- **Diamond**: Decision points (e.g., valid login, valid task details).
- **Arrow**: Flow of the process between steps.

### Flowchart Summary:
1. **Login/Signup** → Successful login leads to the Dashboard.
2. **Dashboard** → Options to add, view, edit, or delete tasks.
3. **Add New Task** → Enter task details, validate, and save.
4. **Edit/View/Delete Task** → Update or delete tasks.
5. **Mark Task as Completed** → Change task status.
6. **Notifications** → Send reminders for approaching deadlines.
7. **Logout** → Exit the system.
